# Spotify Data Analysis
## Top 50 Spotify Songs - 2019 ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ§

This project involves analyzing a dataset of the top 50 Spotify songs from 2019, sourced from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

Our goal is to explore and visualize the data using Python. Here are the main steps we followed:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Converted all column names to lowercase for consistency.
   - Counted the number of songs for each genre and artist.
   - Handled any missing values in the dataset.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual representations of the data.

3. **Machine Learning**:
   - Applied various machine learning algorithms.
   - Built a model to predict the **popularity** of songs.
   - Compared the actual popularity with the predicted values.
   - Visualized the results for better understanding.

## Future Work

There are numerous techniques to develop an effective machine learning model for predicting song popularity. We welcome any corrections and suggestions to improve this project.
